# Ghoztty

A fork of [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) that adds CLI-driven window management for AI agents and automation.

## CLI Window Management

IPC commands communicate with a running Ghoztty instance over a Unix domain socket. All commands are idempotent — named targets that already exist are focused instead of recreated.

### `ghoztty +new-window`

Create or focus a terminal window. Auto-launches Ghoztty if no instance is running.

```
ghoztty +new-window --target=<name> --working-directory=<path> --command=<cmd> --view=<path-or-url> --shell=<path> --title=<title> --split=right|down|left|up --split-command=<cmd> --no-activate -e <args...>
```

- `--shell`: Shell to use for `--command`/`--split-command`, invoked with `-lic` so profile is loaded. Falls back to config `command-shell`, then `$SHELL`, then `/bin/zsh`.
- `--view`: Open a window whose single pane is a **viewer** (see Viewer Panes below) instead of a terminal. Mutually exclusive with `--command`/`-e`.

### `ghoztty +split`

Create a split pane in a running window.

```
ghoztty +split --direction=right|down|left|up --target=<name> --name=<name> --command=<cmd> --view=<path-or-url> --shell=<path> --working-directory=<path> -e <args...>
```

- `--direction`: Split direction. Default: `right`.
- `--target`: Named window to split in (default: most recently focused).
- `--name`: Register the new pane with a name for later targeting.
- `--view`: Open a **viewer** pane (see Viewer Panes below) instead of a terminal. Mutually exclusive with `--command`/`-e`. Works with `--pane` targeting, including splitting off an existing viewer pane.

### `ghoztty +close`

Close a named pane or window. Closing a nonexistent target succeeds silently.

```
ghoztty +close --target=<name>
```

### `ghoztty +read`

Read the last N lines of terminal output from a named pane and print to stdout.

```
ghoztty +read --name=<pane> --lines=<N>
```

- `--name`: Named pane to read from (required).
- `--lines`: Number of lines from the end of scrollback (default: 50).

### `ghoztty +list`

List open windows, tabs, and panes (human-readable tree, or `--json`). Listing auto-registers every pane it discovers, so returned names are immediately usable as targets.

```
ghoztty +list [--json] [--tty=<tty>]
```

- `--tty`: Print only the registered name of the pane whose terminal matches the given tty (`ttys014` or `/dev/ttys014`; raw padded `ps -o tty=` output is accepted), then exit. Exits 1 if no match. Lets a process find its own pane: `ghoztty +list --tty="$(ps -o tty= -p $PPID)"`.

### `ghoztty +sessions`

List the persistent terminal sessions owned by the local `ghoztty-agent` (the daemon that keeps session-persistence PTYs alive across app restarts). Unlike the other IPC commands, this dials the agent **directly** over its 0600 unix socket (`~/.config/ghoztty/local-agent[-debug]/agent.sock`) — NOT the app's IPC socket — so it works even when the Ghoztty app is not running (as long as the agent is). Requires `session-persistence = on`.

```
ghoztty +sessions [--json]
```

Each row reports the session id, liveness (`alive`, or `dead(<code>)` for a tombstoned session), whether a viewer is currently `attached`, the activity state (`idle`/`busy`/`needs_input`), the child pid, `pinned` when the session is protected from the agent's idle-TTL reaper (persistent local panes are pinned so they survive the viewer quitting indefinitely; cross-machine sessions are not), the working directory (when known), and the command. `--json` emits one object per session for scripts and agents.

```bash
ghoztty +sessions
ghoztty +sessions --json
```

### `ghoztty +send-keys`

Send text input to a named pane's terminal PTY.

```
ghoztty +send-keys --target=<name> <text|key>...
```

- `--target`: Named pane or window to send input to. Required.
- `--when-idle`: Poll the target pane's recent output every 500ms until it no longer contains `esc to interrupt` (Claude Code's busy marker) before sending; sends anyway after `--idle-timeout=<seconds>` (default 30) or if the pane can't be read.
- Positional arguments are text or key names, concatenated and written to the PTY.
- Key notation: `C-c` (Ctrl-C), `C-d` (Ctrl-D), `C-z` (Ctrl-Z), etc.
- Named keys: `Enter`, `Tab`, `Escape`, `Space`, `Backspace`
- Escape sequences in text: `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`, `\e`

```bash
ghoztty +send-keys --target=term "ls -la" Enter
ghoztty +send-keys --target=term C-c
ghoztty +send-keys --target=term "hello\tworld\n"
```

### `ghoztty +set-state`

Set the activity state of a named window or pane. The state is aggregated across all panes in a window (priority: `needs_input` > `busy` > `idle`) and shown as a title suffix and custom `AXWindowActivityState` accessibility attribute.

```
ghoztty +set-state --target=<name> --state=<idle|busy|needs_input>
```

- `--target`: Named window or pane. Required.
- `--state`: Activity state. Required. One of `idle`, `busy`, `needs_input`.

```bash
ghoztty +set-state --target=dev --state=busy
ghoztty +set-state --target=dev --state=needs_input
ghoztty +set-state --target=dev --state=idle
```

Processes can also set state via OSC escape sequence: `\033]7777;<state>\007`

### `ghoztty +set-banner`

Set or clear the sticky banner of a named pane or window. The banner is a native overlay rendered above the terminal content of a pane — it persists (survives scrolling, screen clears, and content updates) until changed or cleared. Setting a banner on a window target applies it to that window's focused pane (banners are per-pane).

```
ghoztty +set-banner --target=<name> [--clear] [text...]
```

- `--target`: Named pane or window. Required.
- `--clear`: Remove the banner (empty text does the same).
- All other arguments are treated as the banner text (multiple are joined with spaces).

Banner text supports a small markdown subset: `**bold**`, `*italic*` or `_italic_`, `__underline__`, `` `code` ``, and `[text](url)` clickable links (URL must include a scheme, e.g. `https://`). Note `__underline__` intentionally differs from CommonMark (where `__` is bold). `\` escapes the next character. Unterminated delimiters render literally. A literal `\n` in CLI banner text becomes a line break — banners can span multiple lines (display is capped at 6 lines).

```bash
ghoztty +set-banner --target=dev "**PR #123** — _3 files_, +120/−45 — [view](https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123)"
ghoztty +set-banner --target=dev --clear
```

Processes can also set the banner from inside the pane via OSC escape sequence: `\033]7778;<text>\007` (empty text clears). The interactive equivalent is Cmd+R ("Set Pane Banner…", also in the command palette), which opens a multi-line editor for the focused pane's banner (Return inserts a newline, Cmd+Return saves, Escape cancels).

### `ghoztty +new-remote-window`

Open a terminal window whose shell runs on a remote machine via a `ghoztty-agent`
reached over TCP. Drives the same flow as the Cmd-Shift-N "New Remote Window" menu
action (dial the agent, build a remote surface, open the window), so the remote
path is scriptable/testable from the shell.

```
ghoztty +new-remote-window --host=<host> --port=<port> --working-directory=<path> --shell=<path> --command=<cmd>
```

- `--host`: Agent host (DNS name or literal IP). Required.
- `--port`: Agent TCP port. Required.
- `--working-directory`: Working directory ON THE REMOTE MACHINE for the new
  session. Overrides the machine's per-host default.
- `--shell`: Shell ON THE REMOTE MACHINE to run (e.g. `wsl.exe`,
  `powershell.exe`, `/bin/zsh`). Overrides the machine's per-host default.
- `--command`: Command to run in the remote session instead of an interactive
  shell. Runs through the resolved shell using its native convention (POSIX
  `-lic`, cmd `/c`, powershell/pwsh `-Command`, wsl `--`).

```bash
ghoztty +new-remote-window --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7777
ghoztty +new-remote-window --host=winbox --port=7777 --shell=wsl.exe --working-directory='C:\dev'
```

The remote session uses the remote machine's own default shell and working
directory (the local shell/pwd are NOT forwarded — they would not exist on a
different OS such as a Windows ConPTY agent) unless a **per-host default** or
an explicit flag says otherwise. Per-host defaults (default working directory
+ default shell per machine) are edited in the machine chooser (Cmd-Shift-N →
row `⋯` menu → "Host Settings…") and persist in UserDefaults keyed by relay
device id or `host:port`; explicit `--working-directory`/`--shell` flags
override them per window. New tabs/splits on a remote window use the per-host
default shell too (their cwd inherits from the parent pane).

### Naming

- `+new-window --target=<name>` registers a **window**
- `+split --name=<name>` registers a **pane**
- `+split --target`, `+close --target`, and `+send-keys --target` reference either kind

### Example: three-pane layout

```bash
ghoztty +new-window --target=ide --command="nvim ."
ghoztty +split --target=ide --name=term --direction=down --command=zsh
ghoztty +split --target=ide --name=logs --direction=right --command="tail -f app.log"
# read output from a pane
ghoztty +read --name=logs --lines=5
# teardown
ghoztty +close --target=logs
ghoztty +close --target=term
ghoztty +close --target=ide
```

## Viewer Panes

A pane (or a whole window) can render **content** instead of a terminal: a
markdown file, a plain text/code file, or a website. Viewers live in the
normal split tree — they resize, focus, zoom, close, and persist like any
pane. View-only, no editing.

```bash
ghoztty +new-window --view=README.md                 # viewer window
ghoztty +split --target=dev --name=doc --view=docs/design.md
ghoztty +split --pane=doc --direction=down --view=https://example.com
ghoztty +close --target=doc
```

- **Markdown** (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mdwn`): GitHub-style
  rendering via bundled markdown-it + highlight.js (offline, zero network) —
  headings, GFM tables, nested/task lists, fenced code with syntax
  highlighting, blockquotes, images (relative paths resolve against the
  file's directory), links. Light/dark follows the window appearance.
- **Text/code files** (anything else): syntax-highlighted by extension.
- **Websites** (`http://`/`https://`): the pane navigates there directly.
- **Links** in file viewers: http(s) opens the default browser; a relative
  `.md` link opens another viewer split; other local files open in their
  default app.
- **Live reload**: file viewers watch the file (including atomic saves) and
  re-render preserving scroll position.
- Relative `--view` paths resolve against `--working-directory` if given,
  else the caller's cwd.
- `+list` marks viewer panes with a `view:` prefix (JSON: `"type": "viewer"`
  plus `"url"`); they auto-register names like terminal panes.
- `+read`/`+send-keys`/`+set-state`/`+set-banner` against a viewer fail with
  `... is a viewer pane, not a terminal` (exit 1). `+close` works normally
  and never prompts for viewers.
- Session persistence: viewer panes restore by re-opening their file/URL
  (terminals in the same window re-attach as usual); a missing file restores
  as an in-page error card.
- File → Open (or dragging onto the dock icon, or `open -a Ghoztty file.md`)
  opens `.md`-family files as a viewer window.

## Session Persistence

Terminal processes can be made independent of the GUI app so they survive app
crashes, quits, and binary upgrades (and relaunch across reboots / agent
crashes). It is **opt-in** via config and **off by default**.

- `session-persistence = off|on` (macOS, default `off`). When `on`, new local
  windows/tabs/splits run their shell under the local `ghoztty-agent` (found or
  spawned on demand) instead of directly under the app process, so the child
  processes outlive the app. On next launch the app re-attaches: layout, split
  ratios, titles, working dirs, and gap-filled scrollback come back with the
  **same PIDs** (no restart) as long as the agent stayed alive.
- `session-relaunch = auto|prompt` (default `auto`). Only matters across an
  **agent** restart (reboot / agent upgrade), where the child is gone but its
  metadata was materialized from disk as a relaunchable tombstone. `auto`
  respawns the recorded command in-place with a `--- session restarted ---`
  divider; `prompt` leaves the pane in its exited state for the user to decide.

The agent owns the PTYs, keeps a per-session output ring (2 MB default;
snapshotted to disk for reboot scrollback), persists session metadata to
`sessions.json`, and is packaged as a per-user LaunchAgent so it comes back
after a crash/reboot. The app dials it over a 0600 AF_UNIX socket
(`~/.config/ghoztty/local-agent[-debug]/agent.sock`) with a same-uid peercred
check. Use `+sessions` (above) to enumerate live sessions directly from the
agent, even when the app is not running. Design + measured E2E results:
`docs/design/session-persistence.md`; E2E harness: `scripts/e2e/session-persistence.py`.

Cross-machine session *move* (browse another machine's live sessions from the
Cmd-Shift-N chooser and resume them locally over the relay) is **scoped but not
yet built** — see tasks T16–T18 in `docs/design/session-persistence-tasks.json`.

## Build & Test

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=Debug
```

**NEVER modify, replace, copy over, or touch `/Applications/Ghoztty.app` in any way.** The installed app is the user's primary terminal. Always test with the debug build at `zig-out/Ghoztty-Debug.app`. The debug build uses a separate socket (`ghostty-debug-<uid>.sock`) and a separate bundle identifier so it can run alongside the release app.

## Architecture

- **Zig core** (`src/`): terminal emulation, input handling, CLI commands, IPC client
- **Swift macOS app** (`macos/`): SwiftUI frontend, IPC server, split tree layout
- Split panes use a binary tree (`SplitTree`) with a ratio (0.0–1.0) per split node
- IPC uses JSON messages over a Unix domain socket at `$TMPDIR/ghostty[-debug]-<uid>.sock`
