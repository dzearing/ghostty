/// This MUST be a pointer to the renderer thread's own Async (not a

/// state, so a copy is permanently severed from the instance the
/// renderer thread waits on and every notify() is silently lost
/// (T40: output-driven repaints degraded to cursor-blink cadence).
/// Kqueue/eventfd backends tolerate copies because they share a kernel
/// handle, which is how this went unnoticed on macOS/Linux.
